;;; - handler design -
;;; remit event handlers are expected to be functions
;;; that take a single event map parameter and pull the
;;; data they need from its keys.
;;;
;;; See the pointslope.remit.events namespace for details.

;; - predefined middleware -

  "A middleware function to assoc a given
  key/value pair onto every event prior
  to delegating the call to the supplied
  event-handler function."
