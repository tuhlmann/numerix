  Code taken from https://github.com/pointslope/remit

  This namespace contains functions dealing with
  the publishing and subscription of events.

  Events are maps containing an :event key which
  is used as a core.async pub/sub topic.

  Any data emitted with the event is stored under
  the :data key of the same event map."

(defn emit
  "This function emits events by publishing
  them via core.async's pub/sub mechanism.

  Expects an event-key and (optionally)
  event data.

  Returns the message data structure
  that was emitted."

;; --- event subscription ---

(defn subscribe
  "This function registers a handler function for
  a given event (topic). It does this by establishing
  a core.async subscription on a new channel.

  Expects an event key and handler function.
  Optionally, a pre-existing subscription
  channel can be passed in. This makes it
  easy to re-connect a previous listener
  dynamically.

  If no subscription channel is supplied, a
  new one will be created.

  Returns the subscription channel (which)
  can later be used to unsubscribe.

  Received events will be delegated to the
  supplied function in a go block. The go
  block will exit if the channel is closed.

  In the event of an exception, we will warn
  on the js/console and re-throw.

  usage:

  (subscribe :click (fn [data] ...))

  (let [my-chan (chan)]
    ... more work here ...
    (subscribe my-chan :click (fn [data] ...)))
